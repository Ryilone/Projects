# Projects
All my projects that I've done and a tiny explanation on what it is


area of a circle.py : Calculates the area of a circle using the formula π × radius² and displays the result rounded to two decimals.


arithmetic.py : Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and finding remainders, with example code using the variable friends.


arithmetic2.py : Compares three numbers (x, y, z) to find and print the maximum and minimum values, showing how to use built-in math functions like max() and min().


circumfrence of a circle.py : Computes the circumference of a circle using the formula 2 × π × radius and outputs the result in centimeters.


excerise 1.py :Asks for the length and width of a rectangle and calculates its area by multiplying the two values together.


exercise 2.py : Simulates a basic shopping transaction, asking for the item, price, and quantity, then calculating and printing the total cost before tax.


hypotenus of a right angle triangle.py : Uses the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle, given the other two sides, rounding the answer to two decimals.


If statements.py : Demonstrates conditional statements by checking a user’s age and printing different responses depending on the input value.


if statments 2.py : Uses a simple if-else structure to respond based on whether the user answers “Y” to wanting food.


if statments 3.py : Prompts for a user’s name and checks whether they entered text; if not, it prints a warning, otherwise greets them personally.
